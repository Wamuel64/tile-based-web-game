Open index.html to start the game

This is a turn based tile web game I created to practice my HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery skills. 
On the top left is a how to play the game. On the top right is a little music option for the game for fun.
The game starts with both players on random tiles on the board, never adjacent. 
You can choose to collect power ups across the board.
Once the players are adjacent the fight starts. You can choose to attack or defend.
The game ends when one player loses all their health.
